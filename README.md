# AI-Powered Security Analyzer

## 🎯 Project Overview

The AI-Powered Security Analyzer is a comprehensive cybersecurity solution that combines the power of VirusTotal API, OpenAI's GPT, and Machine Learning to provide real-time threat detection and analysis. This project was developed as part of a hackathon to address the growing need for intelligent cybersecurity tools.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Multi-Vector Analysis:**
  - File Analysis: Detect malware and suspicious files
  - URL Analysis: Identify malicious and phishing URLs
  - Email Analysis: Detect suspicious email addresses and potential threats

- **Triple-Layer Security:**
  1. VirusTotal Integration: Leverage community-driven threat intelligence
  2. Machine Learning Analysis: Pattern recognition and threat prediction
  3. AI-Powered Analysis: Context-aware threat assessment using OpenAI

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In today's digital landscape, cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and harder to detect. Traditional security solutions often:
- Rely on signature-based detection
- Lack real-time analysis capabilities
- Cannot adapt to new threats
- Produce high false-positive rates

## 💡 Our Solution

We developed an intelligent security analyzer that:
1. Combines multiple analysis vectors
2. Provides real-time threat detection
3. Learns from new threats
4. Offers context-aware analysis

   - Challenge: Handling rate limits and async responses from VirusTotal
   - Solution: Implemented robust error handling and request queuing

2. **Machine Learning Accuracy**
   - Challenge: Limited training data for threat detection
   - Solution: Implemented continuous learning from VirusTotal results

3. **Real-time Analysis**
   - Challenge: Processing large files quickly
   - Solution: Optimized file handling and parallel processing

4. **False Positive Reduction**
   - Challenge: High false-positive rates in threat detection
   - Solution: Multi-layer verification using ML and AI
